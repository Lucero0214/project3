    <h1> The History of The Three Stooges </h1>
    <p>The Three Stooges began in 1922 as part of a raucous vaudeville act called "Ted Healy and His Stooges" ("stooges" being show-business slang for on-stage assistants).</p>
    <p>In the act, lead comedian Healy would attempt to sing or tell jokes while his noisy assistants would keep "interrupting" him. .</p>
    <p>Healy would respond by verbally and physically abusing his stooges.</p>
