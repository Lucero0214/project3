00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:03.044
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.351
(explosion booms)

3
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:25.394
(lighthearted music)

4
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.780
(creature vocalizing)

5
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.280
<v ->You're ugly, do you hear me, ugly.</v>

6
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.447
(creature vocalizing)

7
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.760
You are so ugly, you are ugly, ugly.

8
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.230
(creature vocalizing)

9
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.850
I must get rid of that.

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.773
He makes my whole pet shop ugly.

11
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.600
If this plan fails, I will quit and go back to New Jersey.

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.240
<v ->Step on it knuckleheads, we'll be late for the movie.</v>

13
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.030
<v ->I'd sure hate that, they're showing a cartoon.</v>

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.644
<v ->I like cartoons.</v>

15
00:00:58.644 --> 00:01:01.260
<v ->Gentlemen, gentlemen, you have one first prize.</v>

16
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.100
Hooray, hooray, hooray, you are so lucky.

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.050
<v ->Prize, how come we get a prize?</v>

18
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.250
<v ->Yeah, what'd we do?</v>

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.290
<v ->We didn't even enter the contest.</v>

20
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.390
<v ->You win because you are the last persons</v>

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.690
to walk by my shop, therefore, you get first prize.

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.680
<v ->How about that?</v>

23
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.440
<v ->I just love winning contests.</v>

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.620
<v ->Here you are, oh, you are so lucky.</v>

25
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.070
Just bring the ticket to my store this afternoon.

26
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.170
<v All>We won, we won.</v>

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.968
<v Larry>Just plain luck, that's what it was. Hold it-</v>

28
00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:31.801
(both crash)

29
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.260
We don't have any idea what kind of prize we won.

30
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.660
<v ->Hey, that's right. What did we win?</v>

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.523
<v ->Hm. Let's go ask the pet shop man.</v>

32
00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:42.090
<v ->Hey Mister, we were just wondering.</v>

33
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.920
<v ->Yeah, just wondering.</v>

34
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.780
<v ->Uh, what is it that we won?</v>

35
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.690
<v ->You have won a genuine Dinapoodie.</v>

36
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.253
Goodbye and farewell again.

37
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Larry>Gosh, a real dippy ding ding.</v>

38
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:57.519
(both crash)

41
00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:00.240
We don't have any idea what the heck a Dinapoodie is.

42
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.530
<v ->Hey, that's right.</v>

43
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.633
<v ->Well back to the pet shop man.</v>

<v ->Hey Mister, we were just wondering.</v>

45
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.513
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->What's a Dinapoodie?</v>

46
00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:10.596
<v All>Ahhh.</v>

47
00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.650
<v ->Isn't she beautiful?</v>

48
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.672
And she's all yours. Congratulations.

49
00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:18.900

57
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.160

58
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.953
<v ->Oh, no you don't.</v>

59
00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:39.280
I don't accept you's winning tickets.

60
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.880
<v ->You guys are a real comedy team.</v>

65
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.713
Hey, look.

66
00:02:54.713 --> 00:02:56.700
A cute little, old granny lady.

67
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.440
That gives me an idea.

68
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.520
<v ->Congratulations, grandma.</v>

69
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.080
You're just won first prize.

78
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.280
<v ->My donkey you got yourself a deal.</v>

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.910
<v ->Don't yell at us.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.380
<v ->You gave her our ticket.</v>

86
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.880
It's all your fault.

87
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.881
<v ->My fault?</v>

88
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.381
